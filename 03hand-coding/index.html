        <h1>7 Common Chemical Allergies</h1>
            <p>Allergies are over-reactions from our immune systems. Most people are familiar with allergies related to food or the changes of the season, but not allergies to chemicals that create a reaction when they come in contact with skin. </p>
           <p> "<em>Allergic contact dermatitis</em> -- happen when your immune system overreacts to chemicals that are normally harmless. They can be in products you're exposed to over and over, like cleaners, colognes, hair dyes, and personal care items.<strong>Even if you've used them before, you can still have a reaction</strong>."
